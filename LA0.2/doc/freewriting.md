What I want to do with this thing is this.

The first thing I want to do is take a source file, mark it up manually with #
symbols, and then seperate and format the text between those symbols into a
list of files.

A bonus option would be to have some options about how to format the output and
variations on how to name the files.

Further down the road I would like to be able to read in similar information,
but information that has been annotated in a specific way. I would then like to
form this into a tree structure where each node in the tree represents a piece
of the work, and each node in the tree can contain information about what it
contains.

From here it would then be possible to do things like

 - Print a table of contents
 - Print all of the scenes where a certain character speaks
 - Re-structure the narrative based upon various concurrent chains which occur in the story.

And so on.
